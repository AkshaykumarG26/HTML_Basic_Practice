    <p style="width:50%">
        The German Shepherd (German: Deutscher Schäferhund, German pronunciation: 
        [ˈdɔʏtʃɐ ˈʃɛːfɐˌhʊnt]) is a breed of medium to large-sized working dog that 
        originated in Germany. According to the FCI, the breed's English language name 
        is German Shepherd Dog. The breed was officially[who?] known as the "Alsatian Wolf Dog" 
        in the UK from after the First World War until 1977 when its name was changed back to German
        Shepherd.[2] Despite its wolf-like appearance, the German Shepherd is a relatively modern 
        breed of dog, with their origin dating to 1899.

        Bulldogs have characteristically wide heads and shoulders along with a pronounced mandibular 
        prognathism. There are generally thick folds of skin on the brow; round, black, wide-set eyes;
        a short muzzle with characteristic folds called a rope or nose roll above the nose; hanging
        skin under the neck; drooping lips and pointed teeth, and an underbite with an upturned jaw.
